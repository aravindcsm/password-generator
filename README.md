🚀 Password Generator Project in Python 🔐

I recently developed a Password Generator Application using Python, a tool designed to create strong and secure passwords tailored to user specifications. Here's what the project entails:

User Input: The program prompts the user to specify the desired length of the password, ensuring flexibility and customization.

Password Generation: Using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, the application generates a highly secure and random password.

Complexity Assurance: The password includes at least one character from each character set, ensuring it meets strong password requirements.

Output: The generated password is displayed on the screen, ready for use.

This project was a great opportunity to practice Python programming, particularly working with the random and string modules, as well as handling user input and ensuring robust logic for password generation. It’s a simple yet practical tool that can be extended further with additional features like excluding specific characters or saving generated passwords securely.
